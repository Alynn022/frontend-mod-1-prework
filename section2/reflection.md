## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I am somewhere in between, I notice that if I am making progress, then I am more likely to keep trying until I hit a wall for more 25 minutes. After that, I start to figure out how to ask the questions without just being given the answer.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
The simple answers seems a bit harder to google, because the examples given are a little more complex than what the problem entails. But I am comfortable with it, and it will help sharpen what I should be googling for.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement has the structures, if, else if, and else. They are used to set conditions or multiple conditions based on true and false, and then executing a code or outcome.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add multiple conditions to an if statement, you can add different logical operators.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

I often put in different variables and then run node in terminal to check if I get the answer that includes those parameters.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

What are good practices (or tips) to use when naming functions and parameters?
