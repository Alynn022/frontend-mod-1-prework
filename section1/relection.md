## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I definitely agree that the more you read, the more you learn. These are habits that will take some time to build, but they are not habits that are not do-able. Out of the 6 traits, I resonate with 3 and 4 the most. I am always wanting to learn, and adopting a growth mindset is good because then you don't reach a goal and think the learning just ends there. I also like to teach others what I've learned. Especially when I've been stuck on something, I'm sure there are others with the same questions, and I like sharing how I problem solved, or I like sharing my methods. It's also good to spread random knowledge too, because while doing so, you may learn a thing or two, or teach someone something as well. There isn't really anything else I would add to this list, but there are a couple things I need to get into the habit of practicing, like taking care of the brain and taking short breaks.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- String - A string can contain any sequence of characters, visible or invisible. Characters may be repeated.
Example: anything in quotes (single or double)
  var name = 'Mochi'
  var color = 'White'

- Number (Integer) - A whole number (not a fraction) that can be positive, negative, or zero. (No decimals)
Example:
  var age = 11

- Boolean  - subset of algebra used for creating true/false statements. To compare values and return True or False results.  
  Expressions (Operators) -AND -OR -XOR -NOT
  Example:
          var isRelevant = true
          var isBroken = false
- Variable - is a data type used to store specific values within a program.
  Example:
  a variable of a string data type may contain a value of "Sample Text", while a variable of the integer data type may contain, "11".

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
var text = "Hello World!"
console.log(text)

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
characters used: //
The purpose of code comments are for clarity on what is happening on that code line. It is used to add comments directly in the code itself.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is like a box that stores things, and you can add things to it, or change out what is in this box.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
In Amazon.com, 3 variables they could possibly use is Page Name, Page URL, or Image/Text.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
A concatenation happens when you join two or more strings, which could entail values or information that was stored and needs to be combined into one value.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
Developers probably use concatenation when they are trying to combine strings of information like when they want to print a sentence made up of different strings.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
It seems like it is easier to console.log interpolation over concatenation, when would it be better to use concatenation?
