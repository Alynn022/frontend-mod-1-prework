## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I like following the Pomodoro technique, I still need practice on following through with getting up and moving every 25 minutes though. Sometimes I like to work through the Pomodoro alarm, but I realized that when I do get up and walk around, my brain feels less foggy, and I am able to look at my problem differently.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I've been feeling like I haven't had enough time to regularly plan out my schedule for the day due to the hectic schedule of my family emergency... But I do understand the benefits of pre-planning my work intentions for the day. When I first began mod 0, I was able to be more intentional on my day planning, and breaking up my classes and homework. With the upcoming mod 1, I hope to be able to work on this skill to better time manage.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
Objects represent a special data type that is changeable and can be used to store a collection of data, instead of just a single value. While arrays are a special type of variable that is also changeable and can also be used to store a list of values.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - array
  * List of states and their capitals - object
  * List of things to pack for vacation - array
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - array
  * List of student names and their cohort - object
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - object
  * All my favorite restaurants - array

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
On Walmart.com as you're adding items to the cart and checking out, a transaction item object would be used with keys such as, amount, item, serialNumber.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Are there pure circumstances of when camelCase or PascalCase should be used?
