## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
I agree with this statement from the article, "By believing that you can improve your coding skills with effort and practice" because not everything can be learned or developed overnight, believing that you can practice to become better is a way to motivate myself to keep going even when it's tough. I also need to always remember to trust the process, I might be in a hurry and wanting to just learn everything, but trusting the process will remind me to slow down and learn at the correct pace. Some things that stood out to me as brand new is ZPD, I do realize that problem solving is a skill that needs to be learned, but I didn't know that with some guidance you can become better at it. I need to also familiarize myself with S.M.A.R.T. goals (Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals).

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I think I currently demonstrate Growth Mindset when I am not afraid to seek for help. I do challenge myself enough that when I completely hit no progress, that I start seeking help. But I still struggle with how long I am taking to seek help. I do understand that mistakes are essential to learning because there's no way to be perfect, but I do appreciate that there are currently ways to test and check why something may be broken.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Anywhere we need to make a list of different data is a place where developers uses arrays. Contact information through snapchat uses arrays to list the friends in the app.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
Array methods are different functions (shortcuts to me) that can change or calculate something specific to our array of data. There are many different array methods, but for each different method, they can arrange, sort, merge, or have different calculations to the array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is so that you're not having to rewrite the same code to print or calculate for each element in an array. We can use if statements in conjunction with arrays so that the code will read each element and determine if it pertains to what we need.


1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
It's like making a sandwich over and over but with different items or things in a list, but instead of having to write down the directions on how to do it each time, you can just add the one ingredient from the list and keep going until you're done with the list.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
What is a good way to remember all the methods of arrays?
